=============================

This document describes how to push MPS Platform code from your local machine to the
development server (hosted by Online Tech), and get it running.


Setup
=====

01) Make sure your CAR_HOME environment variable is set to the folder of the code you
    want to install. This is usually set in your ~/.bash_profile, for example:
    
export CAR_HOME=/Users/gpoth/MPS/platform/trunk/car

02) It's handy to have a scripts folder on your local machine that's on the command line
    $PATH. You can put various scripts there and then simply type the name of the script
    you want to execute in Terminal. Typical setup would be to create a /scripts folder:
    
$ mkdir ~/scripts

    then put that folder on your path using ~/.bash_profile
    
export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts

03) Copy the $CAR_HOME/config/devserver/pushToDevServer.sh to ~/scripts

$ cp $CAR_HOME/config/devserver/pushToDevServer.sh ~/scripts


Step-by-Step Instructions
=========================

01) Make sure your Subversion working copy has all the code you want to install:

$ svn update

02) Connect to the Online Tech VPN using the FortiClient software.

03) Execute the pushToDevServer.sh script. This script will:
    - start with your $CAR_HOME folder,
    - remove cruft we don't need on the server,
    - remove any existing folder named 'car' from your desktop,
    - remove any existing file named 'car.tar' from your desktop,
    - copy your $CAR_HOME folder to ~/Desktop/car,
    - make a tarball in ~/Desktop/car.tar,
    - set your local working directory to ~/Desktop (i.e. where car.tar got created),
    - begin an sftp connection to the dev server
    
04) Type in the password to gain access to the dev server. You are now in an sftp session,
    and your working directory is mpsadmin's home folder: 
    
sftp> pwd
Remote working directory: /home/mpsadmin
sftp> 

05) All files we transfer from local machines to the server are placed in the 
    /home/mpsadmin/transfer folder by convention. So 'cd' there, remove the old car.tar,
    and push the new car.tar to the server:
    
sftp> cd transfer
sftp> rm car.tar
Removing /home/mpsadmin/transfer/car.tar
sftp> put car.tar

06) This completes the sftp portion of the program, so exit sftp and log back into the
    server via ssh:
    
sftp> exit
$ ssh mpsadmin@10.64.139.145
mpsadmin@10.64.139.145's password: 
Last login: [whenever]
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$

07) Terminate any existing MPS platform programs that are running. THIS IS A MANUAL
    PROCESS:

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ ps aux | grep MPS
mpsadmin 16031  0.0  0.0 103244   872 pts/0    S+   07:21   0:00 grep MPS
mpsadmin 21552  0.0  0.8 265152 17284 ?        S    Feb13   0:10 python MPSAuthSvc.py -e devserver
mpsadmin 21560  0.0  1.0 268352 20424 ?        S    Feb13   0:00 python MPSAdmin.py -e devserver
mpsadmin 21567  0.0  1.2 271708 23800 ?        S    Feb13   0:18 python MPSCV.py -e devserver
mpsadmin 21575  0.0  0.9 265576 17560 ?        S    Feb13   0:00 python MPSLogin.py -e devserver
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ 
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ kill -9 21575
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ kill -9 21567
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ kill -9 21560
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ kill -9 21552
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ 
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ ps aux | grep MPS
mpsadmin 16031  0.0  0.0 103244   872 pts/0    S+   07:21   0:00 grep MPS
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ 

08) Install the updated software. There is a script for this on the dev server. The script
    is in the ~/scripts folder, which has been placed on the PATH, so you can simply type
    the name of the script.
    
    Execute install.sh to:
    - remove old code,
    - untar the new code to the correct location

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ install.sh

09) Make sure nginx is running:

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ ps aux | grep nginx
root      1826  0.0  0.0  44744  1344 ?        Ss   Feb11   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
nginx     1828  0.0  0.1  45684  3720 ?        S    Feb11   0:10 nginx: worker process                   
mpsadmin 16187  0.0  0.0 103248   876 pts/0    S+   07:48   0:00 grep nginx
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ 

If you don't see the root and nginx processes, then you'll need to start nginx:

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ sudo service nginx start
Starting nginx:                                            [  OK  ]
[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ 

10) Start the MPS Platform programs. There is a script for this on the dev server. The script
    is in the ~/scripts folder, which has been placed on the PATH, so you can simply type
    the name of the script.

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ startmps.sh

11) Disconnect from the development server:

[mpsadmin@mpslnx01 ~]$ exit
logout
Connection to 10.64.139.145 closed.
