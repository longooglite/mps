        The University of Michigan Health System ("UMHS") assures the integrity of its workforce and protects its patients in part by conducting (directly or through third-party vendors) background checks on faculty, staff, volunteers and, in some cases, contractors.  Individual background checks currently consist of:
        <ul>
            <li>Social Security Number verification (used to verify a person's identity)</li>
            <li>International, federal, state, and local criminal records, and sex offender registry searches.</li>
            <li>A search of the Fraud and Abuse Control Information System (FACIS) system, which tracks federal health care fraud and federal contractor sanctions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional checks (e.g., employment history, verification of licensure and training information, review of National Practitioner Data Bank entries, drug tests, and so forth) may be conducted in connection with any faculty appointment or Medical Staff member's application for membership and clinical privileges, or with the employment, clinical privileges, or retention of any other licensed, registered or certified health professional.
        <strong>None of these background checks include credit checks or other reviews of financial status or history.</strong>   Your job classification may require such a check under applicable law or UMHS policy, but authorization for any financial background checks will be presented to you for consent separately.</p>
        <p>In addition to these general background checks, Michigan law currently requires long-term care facilities, psychiatric facilities, home health agencies, and other health care providers to conduct criminal background checks (including fingerprint screens) on all employees and contractors with regular, direct access to their patients or patients' financial, health or other identifiable information.
        Thus, some UMHS employees, volunteers, contractors, or applicants must submit to fingerprint screens in addition to the general background checks, which are described further below and at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-35299_63294_27655_27662-138762--,00.html'>http://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-35299_63294_27655_27662-138762--,00.html</a>.</p>
        <p style="font-style:italic">In the event of any change in Michigan law that requires additional checks, all affected current workforce members and prospective applicants will be notified of the change and will be required to consent to those additional checks as a condition of continued employment.</p>
