	</p>
    <p>As the promotion and/or tenure process gets underway, one of the first steps is for you to review and sign the Authorization for Release of Information form (ARI). The ARI authorizes the University to solicit External Reviewers on your behalf and is necessary to move forward with the promotion and/or tenure process.</p>
    <p>To electronically approve your ARI, <a href="{{url}}">please click here</a>. Sign in using your Global ID and Password. Please complete this required step within 72 hours.</p>
    <p>If you have not yet received additional information regarding your promotion and/or tenure from your Discipline Chair, additional instructions and timelines will be forthcoming.</p>
    <p>We look forward to working with you on your promotion.</p>
    <p>Thank you,</p>
    <p>Faculty &amp; Staff Affairs</p>
