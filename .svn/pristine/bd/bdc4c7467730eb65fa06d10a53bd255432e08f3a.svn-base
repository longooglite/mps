I understand that <b>it is my responsibility to complete my application</b> for appointment or reappointment to the University of \
Michigan Health System's ("UMHS") medical staff and/or for clinical privileges, and to provide the University of Michigan,\
  including all University Regents, faculty, staff, and authorized representatives (collectively the "University") any information \
  requested regarding my professional qualifications, clinical competence, character, ability to perform safely and competently, \
  ethics, behavior, or any other matter reasonably having a bearing on my qualifications for appointment or reappointment to the UMHS \
  medical staff or for clinical privileges (my "Credentials"). I also acknowledge my obligation and responsibility to provide the University \
  with any additional information requested after review of the application. <b>MY FAILURE TO COMPLETE MY APPLICATION OR TO PROVIDE ANY REQUESTED \
  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL CAUSE MY APPLICATION TO BE REJECTED AND NOT PROCESSED.</b></p>\
<p>\
    I affirm that the information in my application and all other information I have supplied to the University, whether directly or indirectly, \
  is <b>accurate, complete, and current</b>. All questions have been answered honestly, and even problems that I was previously told were not on my \
  "permanent record" (e.g., prior criminal conduct where I was promised my record had been expunged) have been fully disclosed if responsive to \
  application questions.\
  </p>\
  <p>\
     While my application is pending and, if granted, thereafter while I remain affiliated with UMHS, I will <b>immediately</b> notify the Office of \
    Clinical Affairs and my Service Chief of the following:<br/>\
  <ul>\
    <li>\
    Any developments that impact the accuracy of my application responses including, but not limited to:<br/>\
        <ul>\
            <li><b>Changes in my health</b> that could adversely affect my ability to practice within the current scope of my privileges. (<i>Examples include, but are not limited to, any head injury, stroke, or other neurological injury even if I have been cleared to practice by my personal physician.</i>)</li>\
            <li>Any temporary or permanent <b>lapse, suspension, restriction, fine, penalty, or other negative development</b> in connection with my professional license in any state, my authority to prescribe narcotics (<i>e.g., DEA license or state controlled substance license</i>) , my board certification, or my appointment or privileges at any other medical school, health care facility or health plan. </li>\
        </ul>\
    </li>\
    <li>An investigation initiated by any regulatory or law enforcement agency (<i>e.g., the Michigan Department of Community Health, Bureau of Health Professions; Michigan Attorney General; Drug Enforcement Agency; Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services; DHHS Office of Inspector General; U.S. Department of Justice</i>).</li>\
    <li><b>My arrest, conviction, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere</b> (following my appointment at UMHS) for any criminal conduct, whether the conduct occurred at the University or elsewhere.</li>\
  </ul>\
  </p>\
  <p>I have read the Medical Staff Bylaws and associated rules, policies and procedures, and agree to be bound by and uphold them both in connection with my application, and thereafter if I am granted membership and/or clinical privileges. I also will comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, in addition to University, UMHS, and department-level policies. If I have a question or concern about my obligations, I may consult with my Service Chief, the Office of Clinical Affairs, the Compliance Office, or the University Hotline: 1-866-990-0111 or online at <a href= "http://www.med.umich.edu/compliancehotline">http://www.med.umich.edu/compliancehotline</a>.</p>\
  <p>If I am appointed to the Medical Staff and/or granted clinical privileges, I understand and agree:</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li>I will be responsible to: provide medically appropriate care to each patient; promptly complete all medical records; maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of health information to which I have access; provide or arrange for continuity of care; and at all times behave appropriately with all faculty, staff, trainees, patients and visitors.</li>\
    <li>I will submit to a physical examination, drug and alcohol screens, and other assessments as provided in the Medical Staff Bylaws or other institutional policies and procedures, or as otherwise required by law.</li>\
  </ul>
