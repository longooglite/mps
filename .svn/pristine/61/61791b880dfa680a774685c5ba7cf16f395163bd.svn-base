		As a condition of being considered for a faculty position and/or medical staff membership with privileges at the University of Michigan Health System ("UMHS"):
		<ol>
			<li>I hereby consent to and authorize UMHS or its agents or contractors to conduct background and education checks as described above, including:
				<ul>
				   <li type="a">Verification of information submitted to UMHS, e.g., in applications or on this form</li>
				   <li type="a">Searches of state and federal abuse and neglect registries and databases</li>
				   <li type="a">Searches of state and federal criminal history records that, depending on my job classification, may include fingerprint-based checks</li>
				</ul>
			   I understand that this consent extends to the release and sharing of such information with the Michigan Departments of Community Health, Human Services, Corrections, and State Police.
			</li>
			<li>I hereby consent to and authorize the release of any relevant information to UMHS or its agents or contractors to be used to conduct the background and education check as required under UMHS policy and/or Michigan Public Acts 27, 28 and 29 of 2006 or other applicable law.</li>
			<li>I hereby consent to and agree to participate in a post-offer urine drug test designed to detect the illegal use of drugs or drug metabolites (e.g., use of illegal drugs and/or legal drugs for which I do have a valid prescription).</li>
			<ul>
				<li type="a">In so doing, I waive any and all rights, demands, claims, actions or causes of action against the University of Michigan by reason of this urine drug test, or results thereof, and further agree to hold the University of Michigan free and harmless from any and all claims, demands or causes of action by reason thereof.</li>
				<li type="a">I authorize the drug testing vendor utilized by UMHS for this urine drug test to advise UMHS of the negative/positive status of my test(s). Marijuana use, whether for medical purposes or not, is prohibited and shall be considered a positive drug test.  If I decline such release, I understand and agree that my faculty appointment and employment status will be terminated.</li>
				<li type="a">I understand that if my urine drug test is negative, but sufficiently dilute as defined by specified laboratory criteria, I will be required to test again. Similarly, if my drug test is invalid or rejected, I will be required to test again and/or undergo medical evaluation as determined by the Medical Review Officer.</li>
				<li type="a">I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the drug testing vendor from and against any and all liabilities or judgments arising out of any claim regarding the  University of Michiganâ€™s (i) submission and handling of screening samples (ii) compliance with federal and state law, or (iii) interpretation, use (including faculty/employment decisions) and confidentiality of testing results, except where the vendor is found to have acted negligently with respect to such matters.</li>
				<li type="a">The University of Michigan will not discuss information obtained through the urine drug test except when such information is needed by persons involved in the employment/faculty appointment decision, and/or when such disclosure is required by law.</li>
				<li type="a">I understand that if I fail to cooperate with the urine drug test process or collection procedures (e.g., fail to report to testing center at designated time, refuse test, adulteration or substitution of specimen sample, attempting to alter/tamper with sample), or in the case of a positive test result, my contingent offer of faculty appointment/employment may not become a firm offer, and I potentially will be disqualified from employment or service.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>I understand that UMHS will make the final employment/faculty appointment and medical staff privileges determination subject to the requirements of applicable law.  I also understand that UMHS may terminate the background check or determine not to hire, appoint, grant or retain at any stage of the process.</li>
			<li>I understand that while UMHS' background check program implicates the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), <strong>UMHS is not conducting a credit check or other reviews of financial status or history.</strong>  Nonetheless, I understand that the FCRA may provide me with rights regarding the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information collected.  I understand that more information is available in the document titled "A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act," at the end of this document.</li>
			<li>I understand that UMHS, in denying employment or other position to an applicant, and reasonably relying on information obtained through a background check, is provided immunity from any action brought by an applicant due to the decision.  I hereby further release the University of Michigan and any of its agents and contractors from any other liability that may be incurred in connection with their review and use of information about me collected through the background check program, except in cases of gross negligence or intentional misconduct.</li>
