                Questions sometimes arise about the confidentiality of review letters, and we do want to advise you that your letter will be reviewed by senior faculty at the University of Michigan. As a public institution, legal considerations limit our ability to assure confidentiality, but it is our practice not to release review letters unless required to do so by law. The candidate has signed a document authorizing the University of Michigan to inquire about their qualifications for appointment and releasing from liability any person responding to such an inquiry. A copy of the release is on file at the University of Michigan and will be provided to you if requested.
