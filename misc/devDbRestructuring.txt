Dev Database and URL Restructuring 07/09/2015

The mpsdev database has been split into 2 databases: 'dev' and 'umms'.
This allows us to separate the dev 'sandbox' from the U-M Medical School workflow,
which is important because the Med School will eventually become a real customer.
It also allows us to bring up new sites more efficiently.

Below are step-by-step instructions to allowed continued development on your local machines.

1) Edit /etc/hosts, making sure it contains these lines to access both the dev and umms databases:

127.0.0.1	mps-car.com
127.0.0.1	dev.mps-car.com
127.0.0.1	umms.mps-car.com

2) Reboot.

3) svn up

4) Rebuild your auth database. Your existing procedures for this still work. On Mac,
simply execute the $CAR_HOME/misc/authdb.sh script. This procedure adds both a 'dev'
site and a 'umms' site to to the auth database. The name of the database is still 'mpsauth'.

5) Build your dev database, which is now called 'dev'.
Execute the misc/devdb.sh script, or adapt as necessary for non-Mac environments.

6) Build your umms database, which isnamed 'umms'.
Execute the misc/ummsdb.sh script, or adapt as necessary for non-Mac environments.

7) Access the dev sandbox with the usual URL:
http://dev.mps-car.com:8000

8) Access the umms workflow with the new URL:
http://umms.mps-car.com:8000
